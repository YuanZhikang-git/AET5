In our dataset, there are multiple CSV files: `mcf7.zip`, `covid_signature_ncbi_and_ngdc.zip`, `pc_signature.csv`, `processed_mcf7.zip`,`gen_test.csv`, and `source_genes.csv`. 

These correspond to the drug-induced profile (MCF7 cell line), disease-specific signatures for SARS-CoV-2 and prostate cancer, encoded disease-specific signatures, test samples for the generator, and the mapping between gene order and gene names in the training data, respectively. 

When using the data, please ensure that the gene names and their order correspond correctly.
